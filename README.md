Tool for Uncertainty Accounted Process Synthesis, targeted toward CCUS systems

==OVERVIEW==
This tool is initially based of Dr. Kosan Roh and CCUS team's ArKa-TAC3 (Tool for Analysis of Carbon Capture and Conversion). It is intended to be a guidance tool to assist in higher level decision making that involves development and evaluation of low-TRL CCUS systems.

The tool is targeted for official release on early 2020. Academic demonstrations are to be performed around the same time

==MANUAL==
A user manual is to be drafted after the initial release. The version on this repo contains the raw code workfiles which will have to be consistently updated throughout the active dev cycle.
The program was written in 'Visual Basic'
